        <h1>Welcome to our demo page.</h1>
        <p>
            A part of the GNCTR competition is an expo where teams showcase their work. The various booths generally have activities based around their theme.
            For this year's competition, the electrical subteam decided to develop a video game as one of the activities.
            <br><br>
            While developing the video game for Concrete Toboggan, our members experimented with different controls and physics for the game.
            We want you help in deciding which controls we'll use for the final game.
